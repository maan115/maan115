In a small town, a group of friends decided to explore an abandoned house rumored to be haunted. As they entered, they felt an unsettling chill and noticed the walls lined with old photographs of a smiling family. Intrigued, they ventured upstairs, where a faint whisper beckoned them to a locked door.

Curiosity got the better of them, and they forced it open. Inside, the air turned icy, and they saw the ghostly figure of the mother from the photographs. “Help us,” she whispered, her eyes filled with sorrow. “We can’t leave.”

Suddenly, the door slammed shut behind them, and the whispers grew louder, echoing the family’s cries for help. They realized too late: they weren’t just visitors; they were the next victims of the house’s dark past.
